Today was full of frustration because it was the day that I wanted to get everything set up and start my first hour of code. but it soon turned into 1 hour of troubleshooting the whole thing. The first issue was getting the repo setup and I couldn't clone it for some reason and soon I found out that it was set to private and changing that helped me clone it. But soon after I started to make a hello world file to start out the day and I couldn't push due to my school account still being signed in, I thought I sighed out of everything but I didn't so I had to look up a video on how to set do that but I was to get the sorted out and was able to push my first file.
